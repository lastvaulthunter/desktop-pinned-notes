## Python pinned notes

### Why?
Need to keep notes visible while working? This app creates a small, floating notes window that stays on top of everything else, so you can browse or work without interruption.

### Details
- slider to change transparency of the window
- stores your notes in notes.txt
- stores the settings in settings.json (position of window, transparency)
- dark/light theme support (@polienko)
- autosave notes every X seconds (setting available for change)
